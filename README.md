## Features in Detail

### Window Detection
- Detects all visible windows on screen
- Shows both application name and window title
- Handles multiple windows from the same application
- Automatically excludes desktop elements

### Automatic Monitoring
- Takes screenshots exactly every 2 seconds
- Continues until you stop it or the window closes
- Automatically stops if the monitored window is closed
- Numbers screenshots sequentially for easy sorting

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handles window closure during monitoring
- Validates user input for window selection
- Creates screenshot folder with unique timestamps to avoid conflicts

## Troubleshooting

**"No windows found"**
- Make sure you have at least one application window open
- Check that Screen Recording permission is granted

**"Failed to capture screenshot"**
- Ensure Screen Recording permission is enabled in System Preferences
- The window might have been minimized or closed

**Permission denied when building**
- Make sure you have write permissions in the project directory
- Try running with `sudo` if installing to system directories

## Technical Details

Built with:
- Swift 5.9
- CoreGraphics for window management
- Cocoa for image handling
- Vision framework for OCR text recognition
- AVFoundation for sound playback
- No external dependencies

The app uses native macOS APIs:
- `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` for window enumeration
- `CGWindowListCreateImage` for screenshot capture
- `VNRecognizeTextRequest` for OCR text detection
- Timer-based polling for periodic scanning/capture
- Image cropping for targeted region scanning
